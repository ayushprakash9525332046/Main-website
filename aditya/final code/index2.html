                        <h2>In Case of Flood</h2><br>
                        <p>1- Monitor Weather Alerts: Stay informed with flood warnings from local authorities, weather apps, or news channels.<br><br>
                    
                           2- Move to Higher Ground: Evacuate low-lying and flood-prone areas immediately and move to a safer, elevated location.<br><br>
                    
                           3- Avoid Walking or Driving Through Floodwaters: Even shallow water can be dangerous. Avoid walking or driving in flooded areas as water depth is hard to assess.<br><br>
                    
                           4- Secure Valuables: Move important items, documents, and electronics to higher ground to protect them from water damage.<br><br>
                    
                           5- Prepare an Emergency Kit: Have an emergency kit with essentials like water, non-perishable food, a first aid kit, flashlights, batteries, and important documents.<br><br>
                    
                           6- Turn Off Gas, Electricity, and Water: In case of flooding, turn off gas and electricity to prevent fires and electrocution.<br><br>
